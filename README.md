# Exercism Elixir programming examples

I wanted to try my hand at coding all 94 of the current Exercism exercises.

---

## So far I have completed the following:

- Hello World (hey, gotta start somewhere)
- RNA Transcription (Converts any valid DNA charlist to its RNA equivalent)
- Word Count (Creates a map showing the frequency of each word for a given string)
- Roman Numerals (Converts a positive INT up to 3999 into the right Roman numerals)
- Bob (Parses a given string and responds with 1 of 5 stings)
- Beer Song (Gives either a single verse or range of lyrics printed out, works with any positive INTs)

## Currently working on:

- Markdown (Refactoring exercise)
